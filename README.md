Introduction
The Terraform Controller is a Flux controller that can manage your Terraform resources. Although Flux runs on Kubernetes, whatever you are using Terraform for, the Flux controller can manage it. 

The benefits of using the Terraform Controller : 
Full Gitops Automation

GitOps for existing Terraform resources. 

There is drift detection of Terraform resources and it can be used as a glue for Terraform resources and Kubernetes workloads.

The ability to do manual approvals or auto-approve Terraform plans

The Terraform outputs can be set as a Kubernetes secret

It is also integrated with Terraform Cloud and Terraform 

How does it work?
TF-controller uses the Controller/Runner architecture. The Controller acts as a client, and talks to each Runner's Pod via gRPC. Please make sure

Each Runner's Pod in each Namespace is allowed to open, and serve at port 30000 (the gRPC port of a Runner), and the Controller can connect to it.

The Controller needs to download tar.gz BLOBs from the Source controller via port 80.

The Controller needs to post the events to the Notification controller via port 80.

GitOpsing your Terraform
Prerequisites
Flux >= 0.32

Kubernetes >= 1.20.6. 

Installation via Gitops approach
Now you need to install Terraform Controller. There are many ways to do it, check out the installation docs for more information.

One very easy way to do it is to add this HelmRelease to your bootstrap repository.

1. Install Flux CLI and Kind

$ brew upgrade fluxcd/tap/flux kind
$ brew reinstall fluxcd/tap/flux kind
$ flux --version && kind --version
flux version v0.37.0
kind version 0.17.0
2. Make Personal Access Token for creating repositories
Generate new token in dev settings

Check all permissions under repo & save

Copy PAT to buffer

3. Export env vars locally

export GITHUB_TOKEN=[paste PAT]
echo -n $GITHUB_TOKEN | wc -c
40
4. Create local demo cluster or connect to an existing cluster

kind create cluster

gcloud container clusters get-credentials playground-snigdha --region europe-west1 --project playground-snigdha-s9tqz
5. Simple bootstrap:

flux bootstrap github --owner=snigdhasambitak --repository=flux-tf-controller --private=false --personal=true --path=gke-cluster/playground

6. Clone the newly created git repo to your local workspace

gcl git@github.com:snigdhasambitak/flux-tf-controller.git

cd flux-for-helm-users

‚ùØ tree

            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gotk-sync.yaml
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ kustomization.yaml
Lets also create a folder named tf-controller to store our helm releases, which will be used in the next step


mkdir ./gke-cluster/playground/tf-controller
7.  Lets now install the terraform controller using flux
We'll tell Flux about the Helm repo info with a HelmRepository CR representing a Flux source. Instead of helm add repo you can use flux create source helm to export the CRD to a local file:


flux create source helm tf-controller \
  --url=https://weaveworks.github.io/tf-controller \
  --namespace=flux-system \
  --export > gke-cluster/playground/tf-controller/tf-controller.yaml
  

cat gke-cluster/playground/tf-controller/tf-controller.yaml
---
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: HelmRepository
metadata:
  name: tf-controller
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 1m0s
  url: https://weaveworks.github.io/tf-controller

Next we'll create a HelmRelease Custom Resource locally


flux create helmrelease tf-controller \
  --release-name=tf-controller \
  --source=HelmRepository/tf-controller \
  --chart=tf-controller \
  --chart-version=">=0.2.5" \
  --namespace=flux-system \
  --export > ./gke-cluster/playground/tf-controller/tf-controller-helmrelease.yaml
9. Lets go ahead and push this to Git

git add --all
git commit -m 'Configure tf-controller Helm Repo source and Helm Release' && git push
10. The magic happens now
We can verify that Flux is now managing this Helm release.

üí° If you want to immediately trigger reconciliation on a local demo cluster you can manually call flux reconcile. We shouldn't need to trigger that manually in this demo because we set the interval to 10s.

In real word clusters there are important use cases for setting up webhook receivers to automate this immediacy, and there are equally important use cases for letting your defined sync interval run its course.


flux reconcile helmrelease tf-controller
Flux will add labels


kubectl get deploy tf-controller -o yaml | grep flux
    
    helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/name: tf-controller
    helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/namespace: flux-system
11. Change a new Helm release value through Git
You believe me that we are now doing GitOps, but let's prove it.

Change a value in your HelmRelease CR:

Lets add values and make the replica count to 2


values:
    replicaCount: 2

git commit -am 'Configure values to increment the helm release' && git push
 

We can see our Helm release incremented the revision:


helm ls
NAME         	NAMESPACE  	REVISION	UPDATED                                	STATUS  	CHART              	APP VERSION
tf-controller	flux-system	2       	2022-12-07 22:35:50.017980287 +0000 UTC	deployed	tf-controller-0.9.3	v0.13.1
And that the new release revision applied our change:


helm diff revision tf-controller 1 2

 

Tying in your Terraform resources
And here is where all the beauty of Terraform Controller comes in - it does all the hard work for you. All you will need to do to is

Define the source of your Terraform resources

Enable GitOps Automation

Define source
So let‚Äôs go ahead, here we define a Source controller‚Äôs source (you can pick any of GitRepository, Bucket, OCIRepository). A GitRepository entry could look like this:


apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1
kind: GitRepository
metadata:
  name: gcs-bucket
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 30s
  url: https://github.com/snigdhasambitak/terraform-hello
  ref:
    branch: main

The GitOps Automation mode
The GitOps automation mode could be enabled by setting .spec.approvePlan=auto. In this mode, Terraform resources will be planned, and automatically applied for you. Here is a simple example you can just copy and paste.


apiVersion: infra.contrib.fluxcd.io/v1alpha1
kind: Terraform
metadata:
  name: gcs-bucket
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  approvePlan: "auto"
  interval: 1m
  path: ./
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: gcs-bucket
    namespace: flux-system
  writeOutputsToSecret:
    name: gcs-bucket-output
Once you commit this to Git, you should see Terraform Controller pick this up quickly. 

If it takes time then we can do a manual reconciliation 

If it takes time then we can do a manual reconciliation 

flux reconcile ks flux-system --with-source

To confirm the reconsiliation process lets go a get


k get terraform
NAME         READY   STATUS                                                    AGE
gcs-bucket   True    No drift: main/5c957c477f07b21e8e6d690d515c497911002c69   36m
Get outputs as secrets
We wanted the outputs as secrets which can be lates consumed by some other resources. This was defined in the above section


k get secrets gcs-bucket-output -o yaml

apiVersion: v1
data:
  terraform_hello: SGVsbG8sIGF1ZGllbmNlIQ==
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2022-12-07T23:41:04Z"
  name: gcs-bucket-output
  namespace: flux-system
  ownerReferences:
  - apiVersion: infra.contrib.fluxcd.io/v1alpha1
    controller: true
    kind: Terraform
    name: gcs-bucket
    uid: a97308a2-a617-4670-a48f-61d358b68bb9
  resourceVersion: "113337"
  uid: 8944f0c1-5bb7-4a62-b98a-ba5ecd7e11cc
type: Opaque

Now lets do a base64 decode of the secret and verify if its propagating the right value


‚ùØ echo "SGVsbG8sIGF1ZGllbmNlIQ==" | base64 -D
Hello, audience!%
Awesome! Now finally we have automated this end to end using the gitops way
